### Purpose
This GitHub repository is designed to house data derived from publicly available sources. The primary focus is on listing Scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for various publicly traded companies. Additionally, it provides a comparison of the estimated total monetized emissions against the companies' **EBITDA** (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization).

### Data Standardization and Units
To ensure consistency in reporting, every effort has been made to standardize greenhouse gas data into a uniform unit of **millions of metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (MTCO2e)**. In some cases, this required converting data from other units into MTCO2e.

### Data Sources
Where possible, the source of each company's sustainability disclosure has been recorded. First-hand primary sources, such as disclosures directly from the companies themselves, are preferred to ensure reliability.

### Accuracy and Presentation
While every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the data, this information is presented on a **best-effort basis** due to potential limitations in available disclosures and methodologies.

### Emissions Intensity Ratio
The emissions intensity ratio is calculated by comparing the monetized emissions across all three scopes (Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3) against the company's EBITDA. 

### Monetization Methodology
The monetization of emissions is carried out at a rate of **$236 per metric ton of CO2 equivalents**, as recommended by the International Foundation for Valuing Impacts (IFVI).
